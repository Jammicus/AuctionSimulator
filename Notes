TO DO:

Cover all possible cases for each of the Auctions before merging in to master

Allow user input to determine:
    What auction is run
    Number of bidders
    Money range for bidders
    (Potentially refactor the simulate auction?)


Find the Risk Adverseness Formula
Allow mutiple simulations (Multi thread)
Allow bidders values to change due to risk adverseness
