# Auction Simulator
Updated version of my final year project.


The following types of auctions can be simulated:

* Ascending
* Descending
* First Price
* Second Price


You can also find the optimal bidding point for these auctions based on how much money you are bringing to the auction, and the number of bidders in the auction
